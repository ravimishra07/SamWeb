One-page brief for my new psychiatrist

Why I’m here (today)
- Hypomanic drift with 2 nights near-zero sleep; weeks of poor/fragmented sleep.
- Racing thoughts, distractible, impulsive, low self-control; insight present but hard to act on.
- No elevated goal-directed productivity (feel scattered, not productive).

Safety
- Suicidal thoughts recur during depressive phases (notably 2025-07-22, 2025-07-29); one SOS benzo use with relief; no current plan/intent.
- If risk rises (no sleep again, urges, unsafe behavior), I will go to ER and involve a trusted person.

Major recent stressor
- Resigned from toxic high-stress job on 2025-08-06; I am the sole earner.
- Financial/job insecurity is a major trigger. High-pay tech roles help money but worsen symptoms.

Recent self-directed medication change (about 2–3 months ago)
- Added bupropion; stopped lamotrigine 100 mg. No clear benefit; I worry this contributed to hypomania.

Current medications (verify doses and last taken)
- Lithium carbonate 450 mg twice daily (900 mg/day) — never miss doses.
- Bupropion XL 150 mg daily — currently taking? [yes/no; last dose time]
- Clonazepam 0.25 mg PRN — [last dose time]
- Recently/previously used: Lamotrigine (stopped), Sertraline 100 mg, Quetiapine up to 200 mg for sleep, Zolpidem/melatonin combos; history of valproate.

Adherence/nutrition context
- I may skip meals but I never miss lithium. Hydration/salt intake can vary when I don’t eat well.

Sleep
- Insomnia clusters: 2025-05-28 (no night sleep, ~2h day sleep), late July (07-24 ~3h sleep x several nights), early Aug (current: 2 nights no sleep).
- Late/shifted wake cycles noted late May to early June.

Patterns/triggers from logs (May–Aug 2025)
- Mood: Elevated energy without productive output late May; low/flat late Jul–early Aug.
- Suicidality/panic: 2025-07-22 (panic + SI after relationship trigger), 2025-07-29 (severe SI/panic → SOS clonazepam → calm), SI decreased after resignation 2025-08-06.
- Triggers: Work stress/manager conflict/sleep loss; relationship conflict (Tanvi); financial stress and cigarette/food spending spikes.
- Substances: Cigarettes (variable; reductions 07-17, spikes 07-19); sugary soft drinks. No alcohol/illicit drugs.

Minimal timeline (recent high-signal)
- 2025-05-16: Stopped lamotrigine; planned strict sleep routine.
- 2025-05-28: Near-total insomnia; ~2h day sleep only.
- 2025-06-16–21: New job start; early stability with commute stress.
- 2025-07-22: Panic + suicidal ideation after relationship trigger.
- 2025-07-24: ~3h sleep multiple nights; manager conflict; high stress.
- 2025-07-29: Severe SI/panic; SOS clonazepam; calm afterward.
- 2025-08-06: Resigned due to toxic stress/sleep loss; SI decreased; now unemployed.
- 2025-08-02 to now: Shaky baseline; 2 recent nights no sleep; hypomanic drift.

What I need today
- Urgent sleep plan tonight compatible with lithium (vs hypnotic; consider antipsychotic sleep aid).
- Antidepressant strategy: whether to pause/adjust bupropion during hypomania.
- Mood stabilizer plan: target lithium level and whether to add adjunct (e.g., quetiapine/valproate) given insomnia pattern/history.
- Labs: lithium level, TSH, creatinine/eGFR, electrolytes, LFTs, CBC.
- Clear safety plan with thresholds (no sleep, SI surge, spending spikes).

Fill-ins before visit (I will provide)
- Last doses: lithium AM/PM; bupropion yes/no + time; last clonazepam use.
- Sleep last 7 nights (hours/quality): [ ]
- Cigarettes last 24h and typical/day; sugary drinks/day: [ ]
- Missed doses last 2 weeks: [ ]
- Best prior sleep aid that worked without issues: [ ]

Contact/safety
- If unsafe or impulses escalate, I will seek emergency care immediately and involve a trusted person.
