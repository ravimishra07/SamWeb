  "summary": "Woke up late around 10, got scooty repaired costing 800. Met Tanvi, watched a movie together, but felt she didn’t enjoy it much. She seemed upset when dropped off, possibly because her needs for fun weren’t fully met. Reflected that I might not fully understand her expectations. Despite that, mood feels good, sleep is steady, and energy is fine. Staying cautious about feeling fantastic but not flagging it as hypomania since sleep is okay. Medications seem balanced: antidepressant lifting mood, quetiapine pulling back.",
