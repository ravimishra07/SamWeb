  "summary": "Woke up at 7, went for a run, then studied Android at the library by 9. Worked on SAM project. Felt exhausted and low motivation but still followed the daily structure, which prevented guilt of wasting time. Despite working hard, felt results were insufficient. At night, watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and cried while processing grief about past relationship with Tanvi. The emotional release reduced bitterness and cleared the head, leaving a sense of acceptance.",
