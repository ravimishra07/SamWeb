  "summary": "Work from home. No active tasks since I’m still in my second week and new to the team. Skipped the DSM because I felt I had nothing to contribute, and later felt I should have joined. Mood was a bit dull and bored without any clear reason, even though everything is fine overall. Noticed a slight fear about future performance due to forgetfulness and low willingness to talk to people. Had a light undertone of confrontation with Rahul, but it felt normal for close friends. Feeling the need for clearer direction and thinking of focusing on SAM work this weekend.",
