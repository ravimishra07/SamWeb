  "summary": "I've finally reached Bangalore and started a new chapter with Philips — 29 LPA, solid role, and a calm sense of achievement that doesn't feel inflated or manic. The move feels like both a reward and a reset. My relationship with Tanvi is thriving; she's been emotionally and financially supportive through everything, and we're planning to marry soon. There's a real partnership between us now — not built on highs or dependency, but mutual care and steadiness. My family relationships have also improved drastically, especially with Dad and my sister; there's peace where conflict used to be. Medication-wise, I made the switch some months back — stopped Lamotrigine for a short time, then worked with my doctor to adjust. Now on Lithium 450x2, Quetiapine 50mg, and an antidepressant, and it's been the best combination so far. It stabilizes my mood without dulling joy. I feel balanced, connected, and clear-minded. The sense of happiness feels natural — not forced by energy spikes, just grounded contentment. Life finally feels aligned between work, love, and health.",
