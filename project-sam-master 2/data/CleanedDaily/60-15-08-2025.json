  "summary": "Woke up early at a friend’s place and only slept 5 hours, which felt insufficient. Followed planned routine for the day—interview preparation in the first half and SAM app building in the second half. Managed to go for a run at higher speed, which felt great. Joined a library to study and work, which is helping add structure to my days. Currently at baseline mood with energy that feels normal to others but slightly elevated for me. Main concern is reduced sleep and waking up early feeling unusually fresh, which is a possible early hypomania signal. Plan is to take SOS tonight and aim for a full 8 hours of sleep.",
