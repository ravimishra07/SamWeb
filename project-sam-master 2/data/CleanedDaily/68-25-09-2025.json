  "summary": "Pre-interview contemplation day. Tomorrow's Glance bar raiser round creating underlying anticipation mixed with steady preparation mindset. Spent time in introspective mode - questioning own psychology around boredom benefits and fascination with war documentaries, suggesting healthy self-awareness. Maintained technical Android focus despite emotional processing. Day structure was passive with heavy email consumption rather than active scheduling. Energy neutral but stable, neither high motivation nor low mood. Job search stress evident through LinkedIn device verification needs. Mental state: cautiously optimistic about final interview round while processing deeper thoughts about personal patterns and interests. Overall feeling of being in liminal space between current uncertainty and potential opportunity.",
