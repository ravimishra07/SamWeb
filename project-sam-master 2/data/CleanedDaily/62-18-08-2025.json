  "summary": "Woke late at 9am after fragmented sleep. Felt higher energy than usual despite incomplete rest. Attended a therapy session and technical interview at Coffe.io, handled interview with ~90% confidence. Felt anxious but managed it better than before. Experienced an energetic, hypomanic-like period in the evening but successfully nudged myself back to routine. Ended the day calmer and more regulated.",
