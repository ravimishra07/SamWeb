  "summary": "I worked from home today and spent the day mostly relaxed. I didn’t do much work because my only task was to watch KT videos, and I feel a bit conflicted that I should have watched more. My overall mood stayed neutral. I had normal background stress and some thoughts about responsibilities, but nothing overwhelming. I also had some fun conversations and roasting moments, which didn’t affect my mood much.",
