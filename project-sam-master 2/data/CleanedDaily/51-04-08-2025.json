  "summary": "A slow, non-productive day marked by late waking and minimal activity. Though nothing significant was achieved, the day felt like a much-needed pause. There was some internal conflict — part of the mind felt guilty for wasting time, while another part defended the importance of rest. Evening brought a short study attempt, and the day ended with watching a movie. Overall, a quiet mental recovery day with light guilt and moderate emotional stability.",
