  "summary": "High-energy but irritable day. Maintained routine and studied well. Got a call from Google recruiter, asked for 3 weeks to prepare. Experienced irritation and anger during a conversation with dad, cut the call twice after he interrupted while discussing Tanvi and asked about meds, which felt like weaponizing bipolar. Feeling conflicted about whether the reaction was justified.",
