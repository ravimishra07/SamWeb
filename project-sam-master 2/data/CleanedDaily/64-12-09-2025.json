  "summary": "Slept on time and woke up on time, reached library by 9:30 and revised DSA questions until early afternoon. After 1pm, motivation dipped and I went into autopilot mode. Cigarette intake increased and I spent more on food than I should, feeling indulgent despite financial strain. At the same time, I noticed a faint emergence of hope and self-care beneath the darker patterns. Today felt slightly better than yesterday, with a sense that tomorrow can improve further.",
