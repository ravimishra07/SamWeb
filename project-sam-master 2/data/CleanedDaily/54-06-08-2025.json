  "summary": "Resigned from job due to chronic stress and demoralizing behavior from manager. Feeling emotionally overwhelmed and uncertain about the future. Though unsure if the decision was right, there’s a sense of relief from ongoing suffering and a break from suicidal ideation. Energy is okay but emotional stability is very low. Hoping this marks the beginning of recovery.",
