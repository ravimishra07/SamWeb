  "summary": "Spent the night at Aman's place but couldn’t sleep at all, not even for an hour. Friends were also awake, creating a restless environment. Realized this combination—sleep deprivation, ongoing job resignation, money concerns, job interviews, and project work—is a recipe for emotional instability. Decided to wind down early today to prevent further deterioration. Currently feeling things are under control despite exhaustion.",
