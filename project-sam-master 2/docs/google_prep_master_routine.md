1. **Reduce daily problems** (1-2 instead of 2-3)
2. **Focus on one area** per day instead of all three
3. **Extend study time** by 30 minutes
4. **Skip non-essential activities**

### **If You're Ahead:**
1. **Increase problem difficulty**
2. **Add more complex design problems**
3. **Practice advanced behavioral scenarios**
4. **Start mock interviews earlier**

### **If You're Struggling:**
1. **Review fundamentals** in weak areas
2. **Get help** from peers or mentors
3. **Adjust pace** - quality over quantity
4. **Take breaks** when needed

## **Emergency Mode (Last 2 Weeks)**

### **If Interview is in 2 Weeks:**
- **Double daily time** (6-8 hours)
- **Focus on mock interviews** (3-4 per week)
- **Review weak areas** intensively
- **Practice under pressure** (timed sessions)

### **If Interview is in 1 Week:**
- **Triple daily time** (8-10 hours)
- **Daily mock interviews**
- **Focus on confidence building**
- **Mental preparation** (visualization, relaxation)

## **Remember:**

1. **Consistency > Perfection** - Follow the routine daily
2. **Quality > Quantity** - Understand deeply, don't rush
3. **Review > New Content** - Your anti-pattern is avoiding review
4. **Progress > Perfection** - Track improvement, not perfection

**This is your complete Google prep system. Follow it daily, no thinking required.**
